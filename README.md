# Safer Solana Development

This repository will warehouse code and notes that may help the common Solana developer.

**Use any packages or code examples hosted in this repository at your own risk. Currently nothing in this repository has been formally audited.**

## Packages

- [sealevel-tools] (0.1.0): Tools for Solana program development to promote
  lightweight programs. PRs welcome.

## TODO
- Write examples using [sealevel-tools].
- Write comparative programs using existing Solana program frameworks as more CPI calls get
  introduced to [sealevel-tools]. Document program binary sizes and compute unit usage.
- Write about various gotchas from experience writing various programs (e.g. spooky stack access
  errors using `anchor-lang` with optimized compiles)
